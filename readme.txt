This our first Internet of Things (IoT) project. We are very glad to learn many things that we donâ€™t know yet. In this project we learn about how to collect, store, process, and share sensor data for monitoring as well as act based on sensor data. Beside that, we also learn many programming languages, such as Python, SQL, HTML, PHP, and JavaScript. We hope we can continuously learn about this field of knowledge.


microcontroller = Send_Data_to_Broker.ino
broker = broker.php
web application = Monitoring Page.html

Data flow:
OBJECT --> SENSOR --> microcontroller
--> broker --> DATABASE --> web application
